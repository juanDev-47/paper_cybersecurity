    "context": "Artificial intelligence has been developing since the last century, and although it was useful for very specific purposes, it was not initially used much in software systems. However, in recent years its use has increased significantly and tends to be implemented for many purposes. The area of cybersecurity is not immune to this, and particularly in the area of different types of user authentication and validation, it has been widely used (Zhu & Al-Qaraghuli, 2022).",

    "subtitle2": "There is also a compositional relationship between cyber-attackers and cybersecurity, because if one did not exist, the other would not exist. Companies and cyber-attackers present a relationship of enmity and companies and developers present a labor-type relationship.",
    "definitionTitle": "Definitions",
    "definition1": "Artificial intelligence: Computer program designed to perform certain operations that are considered typical of human intelligence, such as self-learning.",
    "definition2": "Cybersecurity: Cybersecurity is the practice of defending computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from malicious attack.",
    "definition3": "Facial authentication: is a way to identify or confirm the identity of a person through their face",
    "definition4": "Users: Person who habitually uses a service.",
    "definition5": "Companies: A company is a productive unit grouped together and dedicated to developing a profit-oriented economic activity.",
    "definition6": "Software developers: A software developer is in charge of creating the resources that allow the operating system of a computer to manage the programs and applications with which the user performs different tasks.",
    "definition7": "Cyber attackers: Cyber attackers are individuals or groups that use computer technologies and techniques to perform malicious actions online.",
    "needTitle": "Need",
    "need1": "Ontological necessity: To have and to be.",
    "need2": "Axiological need: Protection.",
    "subtitle3": "There is a need to have protection, and be protected, against any type of threat or fraud regarding the privacy of our information.",
    "support_needTitle": "Support need",
    "subtitle4": "Research in artificial intelligence applied to cybersecurity and facial authentication is crucial today, since technology advances by leaps and bounds and security risks too.",
    "subtitle5": "With the increasing amount of data and computer systems, it has become essential to have adequate measures in place to protect sensitive data from cyber threats. The implementation of AI in the evaluation of information security risks is a key issue for the development of any business, since it allows predicting possible security risks and taking preventive measures before they occur. In addition, AI is also used in accurate authentication through facial recognition, including alterations to the face with objects such as masks, hairstyles, hats, and glasses regardless of color.",
    "subtitle6": "However, cybercriminals have also been found to be using AI to create fake faces and other types of images for malicious purposes3. Therefore, it is important to research and develop AI in an ethical and responsible manner to avoid security risks and privacy violations. It is important to note that, although these techniques are very useful for cybersecurity, they can also be used for malicious purposes, such as espionage or mass surveillance.",
    "subtitle7": "The use of AI in cybersecurity is a very important topic, since it is a very useful tool for the protection of information and systems, but it can also be used for malicious purposes, such as espionage or mass surveillance.",
    "problemTitle": "Problem",
    "subtitle8": "Although in modern times there are methods and techniques to satisfy the need to have protection or be protected against cyber attacks (Zhu & Al-Qaraghuli, 2022), these are constantly being modernized (Chaudhuri, 2023), which leads to a problem of finding newer forms of protection in cybersecurity, using current tools, which in this case is artificial intelligence.",
